This Idea that if you dont focus on precision than it is easier to keep track of multiple variables.

In the night sky, if you look directly at a star you cannot see it.  Not until you blur your vision and 
stare off center can you see the object.

Call it something like "not precision variable management" 

If you have an array or matrix of values there will be certain outcomes associated with the set. For instance a
Sum, a mean, variance etc... But these values are not necessarily interdependent.  For a given Sum there are 
approaching Infinate possible ways to achieve a sum of n.

For Example 3:
1+1+1
1+2
2+1
1.5+1.5
-3+6  

...

Now, how is this relavent to managing variables in a non-precise way? Well, for a given outcome there are many different 
ways to achieve it.  I think something that constrains my ability to achieve some stated goal is the self inflicted notion
that I need to precisely understand all variables in an interdependent way before I can even begin said goal.  Lets use a 
desk as an example.  Say you want to build a desk.  It may very well be a good idea to understand the process. Learning about 
wood types, building structures, basic geometry, acquire tooling, draw a design, find space to build it etc etc. This could 
be so overwhelming that it creates a barrier to entry to the project.  You might not feel capable to attempt such a 
project until you fully understand each variable. The not precise way would be to dive straight in and learn along the 
way trading mistakes and waste for the advantage of quick decisions and efficiency.  In the case of the desk there is
no answer as to which method would yield a better desk.  I suppose a more objective metric would be to acces cost over time
and determine which desk was more cost effective.  

This metaphor of the desk works well enough to conceptualize the tradeoff suggessted here.  But what about more complex systems?
Say a Business, a University Course, Society, Reality.  Of course it goes wihtout saying that if you tried to understand 
each variable about a business before starting a business the work load would be prehibitively large.  Not to mention 
reality. 

So there must be some way to use this idea of not precise variable management to be more effective. To get work done.
I for one use this when I feel overwhelmed with a days workload.  I try not to worry about all the little datails before 
approaching problems.  What I lose in mistakes I easliy make up for by acting quickly.  By the end, If the sum is the same 
then the independent variables that make it up do not matter.
