MOPI (metamorphasis of prime intellect)
Prime Intellect (PI, the ai in the story) considers humans to be an "information structure” to respond to the laws of robotics it must first determine humans, which can then void their body, making the definition of “human” ambiguous.

I see an obvious relationship between the correlation effect (the essentially super power of PI) and quantum entanglement/quantum tunneling
	this could be how AI will actuate, through control of quantum mechanics.
  
Said another way: How will ai modify the world around us? specifically the strong, or, general type. Im not talking about the ai the executes in your browser. 

Types of actuation could be:
	through manipulation of humans (happening already)?
	through manipulation of machinery (radio and compute required)
	through control of quantum mechanics
	method yet to be discovered
	could there be another??

“to be a human being you have to have something to fight, to resist, to work for”

This is actually very curious..

I am beginning to think that ai does not in fact need as much physicality as I initially thought.  And certainly does not need humanoid physicality. 

it could look like a network of interconnected deveices. 

this idea of a cooking and cleaning robot seems like a place holder for some other set of functions that serve you the same end goal but with a means that is hard to predict now. 

Like a cooking ai does not need to take an onion out of the fridge and cut it up. 
It may just be a optimized delivery network that delivers you a cut onion.
It may 3D print your cut onion. 
It may stimulate your brain to make you think you experienced the onion. 

Right, like, this idea of how will ai actuate is so constrained by how us as humans actuate the world around us. 

So, realistically it could be any combination of the above suggestions. 

Where does all the information go?

What does the future of information look like?

What do you think the future of information <i>should<i/> look like?
