All hail the mighty Science!

In the future, people will look back on Science as people today look back on, say, flat earth or something like the Ptolemaic system. 

It will be relevant in the context of knowledge, and acknowledged as an important step, but it will be mutually understood that is does not accurately inform reality. 

In the future, there will be states of knowledge that cannot be observed now. Hence, they cannot currently inform science as we know it. 

Take for example that science as we know it describes the observable universe. And in that observable universe there are atoms. Atoms are described to be > 99.9% empty space. In addition, of this < .1% empty space only <5% is visible matter. The rest of the 95% we call 
‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’, which we do not understand. 

We could understand this 99.9% empty space as a quantum field. A space where quarks and gluons could theoretically interact. But this concept only exists in simulation space and is not actually observable. (can someone disprove this for me?) Such is the nature of quantum physics.   

Science is based on the scientific method. And the scientific method is contingent on observing or not the state of a postulate. 

It appears that there are states in the universe that are not observable with our given technology. Or, state of evolutionary biology. 

Quantum physics appears to be built on this concept of acknowledging that there are unobservable states that interact with our reality. 

I do doubt this assumption because the very fact that we can tell that something might exist may prove there existence.

Like, if we can observe the effects of a phenomena, does that not imply existence?

It just seems funny to me that this framework of understanding, what we call Science, only describes something like < 0.00000001 % of the universe.
