Theres this tension between the desire to build the “future” and the desire to live completely in opposition of it.

On one hand build a company, solve a problem, acquire capitol. "Solve problem for others."

On the other build a farm, solve problems, acquire things. "Solve my own problems."

The former is actually kind of depressing because there is no problem that needs to be solved that isnt already,
	*specificically for human survival.*

Although, for human suffering, this is a different question. 
There is also the question of en evolving set of conditions necessary to allow for longer and longer term survival. More on this some other time..

What appears to be most necessary is the need to consolidate solutions that already exist and make them accessible to those who are curious. 

What also appears to be more necessary is the need to maintain the vast framework of ‘solutions’ that are already in place. 

Plumbing is a soution to the water problem. But its actually not a complete solution. 
So, we must either invent new solutions or maintain the old ones. 

What exactally is the problem??

The fact that current plumbing still leaks or the fact that water still isnt where we want it when we want it without maintenance. 

Point is: addressing either problem is a way of building the future, because there is nothing stopping you from collecting rain water or carrying gallons from the creek. 

It should be noted that it is actually valuable and necessary to address both such instances. Solve your problems and the problems of others. Singular pursuit of either wold leave you unfulfilled. 

One relevant critique is that of some pessimist comment on the current state of society (of which there is no shortage). An easy solution is just to drop out! You can go live off the land, support your self and struggle to survive. In fact, if you struggle enough, you will have no mental capacity to even consider what pessimisms might exist in society. You will be too worried about if your crop will survive or if the hunt will be successful. 

Ok, but even still, this is not a satisfying approach to the tension problem. Because, there will still burn a desire to solve problems for others, however small or short lived. 

Obviously we live amongst the tension. You must address your own problems first. Then you can help society solve theirs. But if you are rife with your own problems, there is no sense in trying to help others. You’ll only make more. 

It feels like the hard part is defining my problems in the first place. I mean, all our basic needs are met. Society has already solved all my problems! All I have to do is exist and society will take care of me.

This creates a scenario where “taking my problems into my own hands” becomes arbitrary. Like, why would I carry water from the creek when I can just have plumbing?

To what degree should I own my problems? How responsible should I be for my basic needs? How far down the supply chain should I go?

Because, it is pretty obvious that the more you address your basic needs, the more satisfying a life you may lead. 

For example: if you grow some vegtables, raise some hens, or walk where you need to go.  These actions are all not exactally necessary and require more energy to maintain. But there is definate value associated with them. 

To elaborate a bit more on what I mean by building the future...

One way to think about it is to enable growth. Allow more things to be built, more people to exist and more things for those people to do. 

Another way to think about it is that we have this sense of the future, this concept of how things might be tomorrow, next week, next year.  And we are to some extent condemned to exercise this sense. You have some sense of how things might be in the future and you desire to build it. Not because you are some profit, but becaue there is massive inirtia in human nature and it becomes obvious some future state which might exist.  If you don’t, someone else will. 

Either way, this is a fundamentally different state of mind compared to addressing your own basic needs. 

This is the tension which exists. This is the tension we live amongst.
