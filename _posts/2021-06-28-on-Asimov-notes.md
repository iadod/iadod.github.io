On Asimovs "How Do People Get New Ideas"
	In respect to creativity amongst individuals, isolation is nessary. one's mind must continually 
	work at it. 

	Reference to Kekules Dream as a point to reveries and day dreams as a means to realize ideas.

	for every new idea there are 10,000 foolish ones. hence it can be embarrising to share

"The world in general disapproves of creativity, and to be creative in public is particularly bad. 
Even to speculate in public is rather worrisome. The individuals must, therefore, have the feeling 
that the others won’t object."

"The great ideas of the ages have come from people who weren’t paid to have great ideas, but were
 paid to be teachers or patent clerks or petty officials, or were not paid at all.The great ideas 
came as side issues."

Cerebration*

It seems as though Seclusion and free thiking space are key to creativity.  Otherwise one gets bogged
down by the trappings of social obligations.  this derails the minds eye, with too much interference, 
ideas are lost all together.   


Things must feel unconventional.  

"A psychoanalyst, as I understand it, by asking the right questions (and except for that interfering as
 little as possible), gets the patient himself to discuss his past life in such a way as to elicit new
 understanding of it in his own eyes."

^ This is in direct relation to the essesnce of: to create change, one must create an environment where 
the changer happens upon it them selves and feels they have intuited the thing themselves.
