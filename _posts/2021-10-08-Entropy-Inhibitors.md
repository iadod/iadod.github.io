This idea that the funcntion of inhibiting entropy both defines life and justifies it. 

Ive had it suggested that to inhibit entropy should be the most fundamental definition of what qualifies as "life". 
Some ability to organize matter and energy against its natural entropic tendencies. 
To organize information. 

To <i>differ</i> entropy. 

Entropy is a one way function. It can be paused, but not reversed. 

Likewise, in life, it is satisfying to organize things in a manner which resists decay. All individuals do this to different 
degrees. 

Everything has matter and an energetic state associated with it. And the larger the fraction of this which is organized against 
entropy, the more satisfying the task. And possibly the more effect it has collectively. 

You can create a vase to hold water, or you can create a dam to hold water. Both restrain the waters natural tendency to disperse. 
And, if left alone, the water will eventually do so. In fact, systems need increadible maintenenece to continue their entropy inhibiting 
function. 

Now, in question is this idea of natural entrpy inhibition: a mountain which dams a river. Assuming no concious awareness on 
behalf of the mountain, because there is no organization of the matter which is supposed to maintain the water a certain way, 
is this inhibitign entropy, or is the matter naturally in its highest entropic state?

It would appear that indeed the system is in its highest entropic state because all constituents are organized within their 
local natural function. 

So this concept of entropy in some sense defines life because all matter is constrained by it. 

But how does it justify it?

Im not sure what im getting at but the fact that what we do as humans is specifically against this function is interestig. 
This universal natural tendency to fight entropy. And that because of this tendency, it is in fact human nature, not a 
learned phenomena. This would appear to be self evident as all organisms as we know them do this. 

Therefore, there is some analogy to the idea that by being an agent that inhibits entropy is satisfying. That is to say 
that when you inhibit entropy well, or if you inhibit a lot of entropy, there is pleasure associated with the act. 

Thats why its satisfying to build something, preserve food, organize an event, or clean your room. You are putting energy 
toward a differed grantification that in the mean time will defy its otherwise natural tendencies. Because otherwise, materials 
will decay, food will go bad and youll loose your other sock in your room. But why go through all the trouble in the first place? 

Why subject yourself to a life of maintaing your house by building the house itself?

Why go through the trouble canning your food when you could just eat it?

Why clean your room if it is just going to get messy again? 

All I can think is that this is just a natural biological phenomena and for whatever reason, these habits have allowed us to 
survive and reproduce. I dont think it needs anymore justification than that. 

This brings me to a particular insight: that this function is necessary for mental health. The degree to which you inhibit 
entropy can be correlated to your level of satisfaction with life. We <i>need</i> to organize matter! And not mearly organizing 
information. Although, this is tricky because entropy inhibition itself is storage of information.

Thats why finance and marketing is so depressing. Because you are not actually inhibiting entropy. Well you are, just to a lesser
degree. And this should not be a blanket statement. Because if you are directly associated with the inhibitor function than 
you will experience the residual pleasure. 

All I know is that there is some deep satisfaction in creating and maintaining things. 

An old car that runs great. 

A truck bed full of wood to fuel the winters fire. 

Turning cucumbers into pickles. 

Making your bed.
