how to create an oppressed class

first you would define the hierarchy, or acknowledge the existence of one. 
Then, you would blame the people at the top of the heirarchy for the people at the bottom.
Because if heirarchies are natural, then there is no way to create an oppressed class. They just are.  
On this heirarchy, there are more people at the bottom than at the top.
Without this heirarchy, there will be no ability to justify the idea that some lower ranking group is oppressed by some higher ranking group. The mere claim that any group is oppressed implies that there is a heirarchy. And that it is desireable to ascend it. 

Now it seems that idealistically, what the oppressed class would want is to infiltrate their desired position amongst the heirarchy and occupy it. Solving the oppressed / oppressor problem.  Instead, what should happen in order to be victorious, is that upon infultrating your desired position amongs the hierarchy, you kick out the current occupant. 

This usually requires violence. 
And, it will always end up creating the same problem again. 
You cannot fix oppression with oppression. 
Another approach would be to destroy the heirarchy itself. But to identify some heirarchy to be destroyrd implies that it exists and your in it.  Its not clear to what extent you can destroy something from within without destroying your self. but im not saying its impossible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRZG40yg_mY 

Lets start by defining what we want the heirarchy to look like instead. Because, you will essentially be re orgainizing the current system, not starting from scratch.  I think the only other system that could be implemented would be some sort of egalitarianism. Pure equality. Because, if there is even the slighest possibiltiy that one human is advantaged over another, the system would be heriarchical. 

So lets assume that humans are capable of this. 
How would we go about convincing everyone that the heirarchy is over and everyone is equal now?
Because remember, we have to take this approach in order to effect systemic change. A reordering of the heriarchy will only perpetuate the problem further and possibly even make it worse. 

Now as I begin to advocate for the syetemic change from heriarchy to equality I find myself in a contradiction: How can I be right and some one else wrong if there is equality? because right and wrong exist on a heirarchy where right is superior. 

So, I have to begin by going around agreeing with everyone to display my equality to them. But then, you are agreeing with the system that is in place when the goal is to abolish it. 


Im not sure there is a way out of it.
